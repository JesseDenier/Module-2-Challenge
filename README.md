## Description

This is the second challenge of the UT Coding Bootcamp. It is designed to test my ability to create an interactive website that works on all devices.
Here is a screenshot from the completed site as of 1/4/24.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Here is a link to the website: https://jessedenier.github.io/Portfolio/
This webpage can be opened and interacted with. All tiles can be clicked on to open different websites, and all images can be hovered over to increase their size.

## Credits

This code was made entirely by Jesse Denier. Some aspects were taken from other sites but nothing more than small segments. ChatGPT was used for some minor bug identification and correction.
